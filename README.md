ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€˜m Paul.

I am a Business Administration & Engineering student at RWTH Aachen, currently completing my master's. Thanks for checking out my github!

ðŸ”§ **I worked on**
- deep learning approaches for **time-series clustering**
- **state estimation frameworks** based on operational data for batteries
- **explainable AI** approaches for computer vision models
- unsupervised NLP methods for **topic modelling**
- **factor research** for quantitative investment approaches
and some more...

ðŸ‘€ **I genuinely enjoy**
- Analytical thinking and mathematical problems
- Technology and its playbook from engineering to programming 
- Strategic, conceptual work
- Learning and meeting inspiring people

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** (or trying to)
- improving training of deep clustering methods
- semi-supervised learning for state prediction
- physics-informed neural networks
- reinforcement learning

Story to be continued..
